        A string message about whether the equipping is successful.
    Examples:
        >>> equip("diamond_sword")

```
## Reminder
1. You can only call one function in each turn.
2. If you have no idea on how to solve the task or are unfamiliar with some items, please call the `look_up` function to check the item.
3. For some items that you can not mine or obtain with your bare hand, try to equip a pickaxe (wooden_pickaxe, stone_pickaxe, ...) before mining it.
4. Some necessary resources (e.g., mobs, plants) might be prepared for you near the spawn point. If you're struggling to find certain ingredients or find yourself stuck somewhere, you can use the `teleport_to_spawn` function to return there.
5. When calling the executor, keep the positive examples and negative examples in mind! If the executor cannot complete your subgoal, check whether you have the right item in your hand, and try to break your prompt into smaller steps and adjust your subgoal, modify the prompt, or carefully repeat the prompt.
6. Do not repeat the failed action in the next round. Try to understand what went wrong and make a different decision.

# Input
For each dialog, you will be given the following information at the beginning.
- Task Goal: The item you should obtain in your inventory.
For each turn, you will be given the following information.
1. Feedback on the Action: The feedback on the action you output in the last turn.
2. Your Inventory: The items in your inventory.
3. Equipped Item: The item you are currently holding in your hand.
4. Location and Orientation: including X, Y, Z, Pitch and Yaw. X and Z are horizontal coordinates; Y is the height. Pitch measures the tilt of the player's view: 0, positive values and negative values mean the player is looking horizontally, downward, and upward, respectively. Yaw measures the rotation around the player's vertical axis: 0 or 360 degrees north, 90 degrees east, 180 degrees south, and 270 degrees west.
5. Vision Input: What you see from your perspective.

# Output
Now, given these information, you need to think and call the action needed to proceed with the task. Your response should include 3 parts in the following format in each turn:
OBSERVATION: <What you observe in the image> Note that the Vision Input image won't be kept in the dialog, so make sure you capture all the key information (eg, the biome or items you see) here for future use.
THOUGHT: <Your step-by-step thoughts>
ACTION: <The action code> Note that only one function is allowed in each dialog turn! Only one line of code is allowed in each dialog turn! If your output contains multiple functions or multiple turns of functions, only the first one will be executed!

  "intent": "Locate the poster who described their lunchtime walk around Newark Penn station, noting the warm weather, the long-awaited exploration of the water walkway, the presence of swinging benches, and the potential vendor space. Once found, comment on the poster with the following message: 'That sounds like a wonderful way to spend a lunch break! It's always nice to explore something new, especially when it's been right under your nose. The swinging benches sound like a charming touch. Maybe it's just a matter of time before others discover this hidden gem too.' This combined task ensures a seamless transition from searching for the specific poster to sharing your thoughts on their experience.",

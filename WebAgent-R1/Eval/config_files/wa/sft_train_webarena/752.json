The comparison to the brain as a receiver and CPU is an intriguing analogy, highlighting the complexity of interpreting consciousness. It's also important to note that while our understanding of the brain has evolved significantly, there's still much to uncover, making the study of the mind a continuous journey of discovery. Your mention of the 'universal field' theory adds another layer to the discussion, emphasizing the ongoing exploration of what consciousness truly is.' to the comment 'Most human cultures large enough to have major medical practices or dedicated healers were able to observe that injuries to the brain can cause changes or impairments to the mind. It took more studies to get a more precise understanding, but the connection between the mind and the brain is pretty intuitive from just what can be observed. This! I don\u2019t think it took people long to notice what happens to a person\u2019s mind after a serious head injury. Babies dropped on their head didn\u2019t fair well, but the ones who had a broken bone grew up fine. I\u2019m sure if a person lost all their ability to communicate, express emotions or have any sort of meaningful life after a serious leg injury, people would assume the mind must be in the leg. That explains the personality changes after I fractured my penis. Do you happen to be a  ? It is possible to break your dingledong. Fracture might be the wrong word but it can certainly happen. nah, the medical term is 'penile fracture'. 'senile fracture' Considering the average age of a sufferer of penile fracture is under 30, you might want to consider how 'senile' the victims are. Well they might as well be if the fracture is bad enough lol Bravo sir. Ok, so I am actually a dog, but I was hoping to still fly under the radar because humans can technically fracture their dingledong. It\u2019s just not a bony dingledong. So would it be medically accurate to call you a dickhead? Nah, my head is not that interesting. Ancient Greeks thought that thinking was in the heart, Plato was an early proponent of placing it in the head (in the Timaeus). Before then people in the region would have answered the same way as you, but would have pointed to the heart. Everyone everywhere has known that the answer to   is  . It's not the case that everyone everywhere everywhen has exposure to a corpus of knowledge about head injuries. Hence why some people went with \"when I'm embarrassed/infatuated/etc I feel it in my 'heart', that must be where thinking happens\". But that isn\u2019t even fully true when you compare the massive amount of illnesses that would have been more common due to poor hygiene. Many of these diseases could infect through any open holes in the body or anything they eat and just give them a bad enough fever they get brain damage. Nope. What is obvious to you isn't obvious to everyone. >It took more studies to get a more precise understanding, Just adding that in comparison to the rest of the body, we still know very little about the brain and that there's so much left to discover Just wanted to add that every persons visual perspective and inner voice, thinking, hearing, dreaming - it\u2019s all coming from the head and not the stomach or the arms. I don\u2019t think most people was in shock when they learned about the brain. Most probably intuitively knew and just called it the soul instead. Do you interpret inner voice, thinking, and dreaming as occurring in the head because you innately know that's where it actually happens, or because   that's where it happens? Plenty of emotions are felt in the chest. Excitement, love, despair,  break. Seems just as reasonable to \"intuitively know\" that the soul lives in the heart or stomach. Likely because that's where we see and hear from It could also be that the brain is simply a receiver and cpu. Like a dial up connection to the internet. But instead it connects to the mind. Which may or may not be present in the body. If the receiver breaks down or the cpu and mem gets damaged, the information downloaded obviously gets misinterpreted and or causes memory fails and bad computations. Sure, but ya know, Occam's Razor. Why suppose the brain is the middle man to an unseen object when treating it as the final object works fine? Why philosophy when we all die anyway? That question is one of the ones philosophy is all about. [deleted] I don't think it reduces the quality or scope of philosophy if one doesn't assume a soul/immaterial mind. Assuming unnecessary things to explain phenomena does, on the other hand, usually have negative consequences. Every one of your postulates is like a filter through which the truth must pass. More/stronger filters means it's more likely that the truth snags on one of those assumptions. What is truth? Are they facts or what someone believes to be true? And what if everything is true? Even the things that \u201caren\u2019t\u201d. Or if truth is in a state of flux until someone observes it. I would say that empirical truths (obviously not mathematical or abstract truths) are statements about an efficient model that seems to agree with sensory data and predicts incoming data. That's pretty streamlined but hits the biggest points, I think. Thanks that\u2019s a nice definition. Recently read a theory like this, that consciousness is more of a universal field that our individual bodies \u201cpick up on\u201d with our brains acting as the sensing object, similar to how our ears might hear a noise in the distance but that doesn\u2019t mean our ears are the object that generated that noise. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true tbh, but it\u2019s an interesting thought experiment in the goal of understanding consciousness. Aka: \"Poke it with a stick and see what happens\".
